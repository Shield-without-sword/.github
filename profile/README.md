# 🛡️ Shield Without Sword 🗡

**Hackathon Survivors | The “Works on My Machine” Crew | Building Features No One Asked For**  

Welcome to **Shield Without Sword**, where we charge into hackathons, coding sprints, and caffeine-fueled nights—without a sword, but with plenty of brainpower. 🧠⚡ We don’t just build projects; we *over-engineer* them for the fun of it.

## 🛠️ **Who We Are**  

We’re a squad of full-stack devs who thrive on **hackathons, ridiculous coding challenges, and way too many late-night debates about semicolons**. Our expertise? **MERN stack, some occasional ML sprinkles, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting.**  

If you've ever looked at a feature and thought, *"This is way too practical"*, don’t worry—we’ll find a way to complicate it.

## 📌 **Some of Our Glorious Creations**  

- 📜[**Will Chain**](https://github.com/Shiel-without-sword/Will-Managment-1.0) - A legally questionable (but surprisingly useful) way to manage wills online. Think *smart contracts* but without the confusing crypto stuff.  
- 🎉[**Eventify**](https://github.com/Shield-without-sword/Eventify): A MERN stack event invitation platform where users create events and share invite links. Guests RSVP without logging in, get a QR entry pass, and a media upload link if they accept. Simple, seamless, and efficient
- 📚[**Full Stack LMS**](https://github.com/Shield-without-sword/LMS): A **MERN stack** application that provides structured learning modules, interactive quizzes, AI-powered interview preparation, real-time collaboration, and a VR-driven community experience.
- 🤝[**Aamchi मुंबई**](https://github.com/Shield-without-sword/Aamchi-Mumbai): It enables NGOs to efficiently manage events while allowing volunteers to track their contributions, measure their impact, and showcase their achievements through a personalized dashboard.

## 🚀 **What’s Next?**  

More hackathons. More caffeine. More borderline unhinged projects. We don’t know what we’re building next, but it’s probably going to involve too many API calls and at least one existential crisis.  
> *Note: We appreciate interest, but we aren’t currently expanding our team. This organization was created to streamline collaboration among existing members.*

## 💡 **Why We Created This Organization**  

Managing repos across different profiles got annoying, so we made this. Now everything is in one place, and we don’t have to keep asking, *"Who has the latest commit?"* every 15 minutes.

Feel free to check out our projects, steal some ideas (but like, credit us), and join us in making the internet a slightly more chaotic place.
